## Features

- **Real-time usage tracking** - Monitor your Claude Code session and weekly usage limits
- **Multiple display modes**:
  - Text: Shows percentages directly (e.g., `CC: 45% (32% weekly)`)
  - Pie Charts: Visual representation with two pie charts
  - Bar Charts: Stacked horizontal bars
- **Color-coded indicators** - Green (<70%), Orange (70-89%), Red (90%+)
- **Configurable refresh intervals** - From 1 minute to 30 minutes
- **Session reset times** - See when your session usage will reset

## Disclaimer

Honestly, I vibe coded this thing in the space of an hour. It works for me, hopefully it works for you too. I just wanted to be able to keep an eye on my token budget without having to manually go looking for it.

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed at `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `clive.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run (⌘R)
4. Optionally, add to Login Items for auto-start

## Usage

Once running, Clive appears in your menu bar showing your Claude Code usage. Click the icon to see:

- **Session usage** - Current session percentage and reset time
- **Weekly usage** - Current week's percentage

Access Settings (⌘,) to configure:
- Display mode (Text, Pie Charts, or Bar Charts)
- Refresh interval (1-30 minutes)

## How It Works

Clive periodically runs `claude /usage` to fetch your current usage statistics and displays them in the menu bar. The app parses the output to extract session and weekly usage percentages.
No hacking of session tokens etc required :).
